niasAS041216_tri.lonlat --- it is the coordinates for the triangular vertices 
niasAS041216_tri.net  --- the triangulation to form the triangular elements
inverse_okada_slip_dist_Nias2005_exp222_LonLatSlipTri.txt ---- the coseismic slip file. In the file itself, it has the header for the meaning of each column
niasAS_270618.txt --- it is the afterslip estimates on the same fault as the coseismic. The slip is saved in alternative way e.g., you can get strike slip and dip slip in this way in Matlab. pp = load('2005nias_AS_paul_Banyak.txt'); ss = pp(1:2:end); ds = pp(2:2:end);
