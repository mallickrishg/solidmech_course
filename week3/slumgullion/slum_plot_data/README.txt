All data are in WGS84 coordinate system, i.e., longitude, latitude.

kinematic_elements: the locations for 12 kinematic elements

displacement_mm_day.txt: the last column hor_mm_day, i.e., sqrt(e^2+n^2), was used for the colored dots in figure 3a; the arrows were generated using e_mm_day and n_mm_day.

extensometers_position.txt: the locations for 3 extensometers (diamond symbols in the figure)
